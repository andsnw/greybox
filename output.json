      "name": "Integer Overflow and Underflow",
      "description": "Check for potential integer overflow and underflow vulnerabilities. These occur when arithmetic operations exceed a variable's data type limits, leading to unexpected behavior in smart contracts. Risks include incorrect balance calculations, bypassing time-based restrictions, and corrupting critical state variables. The impact can be severe, resulting in financial losses, contract malfunctions, or complete compromise of intended functionality. In high-stakes financial applications, these vulnerabilities can cause significant monetary damage and erode user trust.\n",
