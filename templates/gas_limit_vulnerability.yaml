name: Gas Limit Vulnerability
description: Check for potential gas limit vulnerabilities
severity: High
reference: https://owasp.org/www-project-smart-contract-top-10/2023/en/src/SC09-gas-limit-vulnerabilities.html

patterns:
  - name: Unbounded loop
    description: Checks for loops that might iterate over large amounts
    regex:
      - 'for\s*\(\s*uint\d*\s+\w+\s*=\s*0\s*;\s*\w+\s*<\s*\w+\s*;'
      - 'while\s*\(\s*\w+\s*<\s*\w+\s*\)'

mitigation:
  - Implement pagination or batching for operations on large data sets
  - Use pull payment patterns instead of push for token transfers
  - Avoid loops with unbounded gas consumption
  - Optimize data structures to reduce gas costs
