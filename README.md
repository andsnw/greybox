# Greybox

Greybox is a dynamic testing framework for Ethereum smart contracts. Inspired by Nuclei, the goal of this project is to build a templating engine that is capable of performing security assessments of smart contracts, beyond just code audits and static analysis.

Built for EthSydney Hackathon 2024 (Blockathon).
